  # Simple Blog

  ## Description

  This is a simple blog that allows users to make posts about Tech. When a user is registered and logged in they can make new posts and comment posts. This is a full stack web application that uses mysql, sequelize, and express to store and route all information. It uses handlebars to render the information. Bcrypt is used to protect the stored password and the user's logged in status is saved in a sequelize connect-session so that they are autologged in upon returning to the page.
